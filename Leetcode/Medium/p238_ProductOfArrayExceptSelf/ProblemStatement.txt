LeetCode Medium Problem: Product of Array Except Self

Description:
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using division.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
