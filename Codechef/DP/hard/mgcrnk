### Magic Rankings Problem Explanation  

Cyael is a magician competing in the **Byteland Magic Tournament**. Her performance will be judged by multiple judges, and she wants to maximize her tournament ranking.  

She performs in an **N × N** square room, where each cell contains a judge who can give her a score. However, some judges might give **negative points or zero points**.  

### Movement Rules  
- Cyael **must** start at the **top-left corner** of the room **(1,1)**.  
- She must reach the **bottom-right corner** **(N,N)**.  
- She can move **right** to the next cell in the same row **(r, c) → (r, c+1)**.  
- She can move **down** to the next row in the same column **(r, c) → (r+1, c)**.  
- The starting **(1,1)** and ending **(N,N)** cells do not contain judges.  

### Goal  
Cyael wants to **maximize the average score** she gets from the judges she encounters along her path.  

If she follows a path where she meets **K** judges at positions **(i1, j1), (i2, j2), ..., (iK, jK)**, her **average score** is:  

\[
\frac{S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]}{K}
\]

Where **S[i][j]** is the score given by the judge at that cell.  

### Input Format  
1. The first line contains an integer **T** (number of test cases).  
2. Each test case starts with an integer **N** (size of the room).  
3. The next **N** lines contain **N** space-separated integers, where the **j-th** integer in the **i-th** line represents **S[i][j]**, the score at that cell.  
4. The values at **(1,1)** and **(N,N)** will always be **0**.  

### Output Format  
- If the maximum possible average score is **negative**, print **"Bad Judges"**.  
- Otherwise, print the **maximum possible average score** with at least **six decimal places of precision**.  

### Constraints  
- \(1 \leq T \leq 20\) (Number of test cases)  
- \(2 \leq N \leq 100\) (Size of the grid)  
- \(-2500 \leq S[i][j] \leq 2500\) (Score range)  

### Example  

#### **Input**  
```
2  
2  
0 -4  
8 0  
2  
0 -45  
-3 0  
```

#### **Output**  
```
8.000000  
Bad Judges  
```

### Explanation  
#### **Test Case 1**  
One possible optimal path:  
**(1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2)**  

- Judges encountered: **1**  
- Total points: **8**  
- Average score: **8.000000**  

#### **Test Case 2**  
No matter which path Cyael chooses, the **best possible score is negative**. So, the output is **"Bad Judges"**.
