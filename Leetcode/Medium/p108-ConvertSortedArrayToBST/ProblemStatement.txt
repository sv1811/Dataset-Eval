LeetCode Easy Problem: Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Description:
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order
