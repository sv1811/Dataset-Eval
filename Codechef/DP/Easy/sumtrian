Sums in a Triangle  

Problem Statement  
Given an integer N, consider a triangle of numbers with N lines, where:  
- The first line contains a single number a_11.  
- The second line contains two numbers a_21 and a_22.  
- The third line contains three numbers a_31, a_32, and a_33.  
- In general, the i-th line contains i numbers a_i1, a_i2, ..., a_ii.  

Develop a program to compute the largest sum of numbers along a path from the top of the triangle to the base, following these rules:  
- Each step must move to the row below, either directly below or one place to the right.  

Warning: Large Input/Output data—be cautious with certain languages.  

Input Format  
- The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.  
- Each test case starts with an integer N, the number of rows.  
- The next N lines contain the triangle's values. The i-th line has i integers.  

Output Format  
For each test case, print the maximum path sum in a separate line.  

Constraints  
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000  
- 1 ≤ N < 100  
- 0 ≤ a_ij < 100  

Examples  

Test Case 1  
Given the triangle:  
1  
1 2  
1 2 3  

Possible paths and their sums:  
1. (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → sum = 4  
2. (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,2) → sum = 5  
3. (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → sum = 4  
4. (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) → sum = 5  

Maximum path sum = 5  

Test Case 2  
Given the triangle:  
1  
1 2  
1 2 3  
1 2 3 4  

Possible paths and their sums:  
1. (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → sum = 8  
2. (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,2) → sum = 9  
3. (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,2) → (4,2) → sum = 7  
4. (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,2) → (4,3) → sum = 4  
5. (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → sum = 7  
6. (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,3) → sum = 5  
7. (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) → (4,3) → sum = 6  
8. (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) → (4,4) → sum = 6  

Maximum path sum = 9
