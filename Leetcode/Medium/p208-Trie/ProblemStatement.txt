LeetCode Medium Problem: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)

Description:
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings. Implement the Trie class:
- Trie() Initializes the trie object.
- void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
- boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
- boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

Example:
Input:
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output:
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Constraints:
- 1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000
- word and prefix consist only of lowercase English letters.
- At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to insert, search, and startsWith.
