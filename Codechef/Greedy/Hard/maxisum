### Problem Explanation: Maximize the Sum

You are given two integer arrays, **A** and **B**, each of size **N**. The "interaction" between these two arrays is defined as the sum of the product of their corresponding elements:

\[
\text{interaction} = A[1] * B[1] + A[2] * B[2] + \dots + A[N] * B[N]
\]

You want to maximize this "interaction". You are allowed to perform at most **K** operations. Each operation allows you to increase or decrease any element in array **A** by 1.

### Task:
Your goal is to find the maximum value of the "interaction" that you can achieve after performing at most **K** operations.

### Input:

- **T**: The number of test cases.
  
For each test case:
1. Two space-separated integers, **N** (size of arrays) and **K** (maximum number of operations).
2. An array **A** of size **N**.
3. An array **B** of size **N**.

### Output:

For each test case, print a single integer: the maximum possible interaction after performing at most **K** operations.

### Constraints:

- **1 ≤ T ≤ 10**
- **1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5**
- **0 ≤ |A[i]|, |B[i]| ≤ 10^5**
- **0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9**

### Subtasks:

1. **(25 points)**: **1 ≤ N ≤ 10**, **0 ≤ |A[i]|, |B[i]| ≤ 10**, **0 ≤ K ≤ 10**
2. **(35 points)**: **1 ≤ N ≤ 1000**, **0 ≤ |A[i]|, |B[i]| ≤ 1000**, **0 ≤ K ≤ 10^5**
3. **(40 points)**: No additional constraints.

### Sample Input:
```
2
2 2
1 2
-2 3
3 5
1 2 -3
-2 3 -5
```

### Sample Output:
```
10
44
```

### Explanation:

- **Test case 1**: You can increase **A[2]** by 2 operations, making **A = [1, 4]**. The interaction will be:
  \[
  1 * -2 + 4 * 3 = -2 + 12 = 10
  \]

- **Test case 2**: After performing the allowed operations on **A**, the maximum interaction is 44.
