### Problem Explanation: Breaking Into Atoms

You are given a set **X** containing integers from **0** to **n-1**. Additionally, there are **m** subsets, each containing some elements from **X**. 

Your task is to **partition** the set **X** into **atoms**. An atom is a subset of **X** such that:
1. For each of the given subsets, either:
   - The atom is entirely contained within that subset.
   - The atom and the subset do not overlap (they have no common elements).

You need to find the **minimum number of such atoms** required to cover all of **X** where:
- Every element in **X** belongs to exactly one atom.
- No two atoms share any elements.

### Input:
1. The first line contains an integer **t**, the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - You are given two integers **n** and **m**:
     - **n** is the size of the set **X** (which contains elements from 0 to n-1).
     - **m** is the number of subsets.
   - The next **m** lines describe the subsets:
     - Each line starts with an integer **v_i**, the size of the **i-th** subset, followed by **v_i** integers, which are the elements of that subset.

### Output:
For each test case, you need to output the minimum number of atoms required to partition **X** while satisfying the constraints.

### Example:

#### Input:
```
2
5 2
3 0 1 2
3 2 3 4
4 3
2 0 1
2 1 2
2 2 3
```

#### Output:
```
4
3
```

### Explanation:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - **X = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}**
  - The first subset contains **{0, 1, 2}** and the second subset contains **{2, 3, 4}**.
  - The partition can be made using the following atoms:
    - **{0}**
    - **{1}**
    - **{2}**
    - **{3, 4}**
  - So, the minimum number of atoms is **4**.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - **X = {0, 1, 2, 3}**
  - The first subset contains **{0, 1}**, the second contains **{1, 2}**, and the third contains **{2, 3}**.
  - The partition can be made using the following atoms:
    - **{0}**
    - **{1}**
    - **{2, 3}**
  - So, the minimum number of atoms is **3**.

### Key Ideas:
- The problem asks you to find the smallest number of partitions (atoms) where each atom meets the condition of being inside or disjoint with each subset.
- The goal is to cover **X** using the fewest possible subsets (atoms) while ensuring that no two atoms overlap.

### Constraints:
- The size of **X** (n) is at most **100**.
- The number of subsets (m) is at most **30**.
- You are guaranteed that each element of **X** appears in at least one of the subsets.

### Solution Approach:
- You need to use a strategy to break down the set **X** into minimal, non-overlapping subsets (atoms).
- This may involve understanding how the subsets overlap and finding a way to group elements into distinct atoms that cover the entire set **X**.
